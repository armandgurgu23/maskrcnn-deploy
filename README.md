<h1> Description of Application </h1>

This repository can be used to visualize predictions by an object detection and instance segmentation model in the browser. The front end for this application was built using ReactJS and Axios. The back end web server was built using Python and FastAPI. The vision model used is a pretrained Mask-RCNN model available in the torchvision library provided by PyTorch.

<h2> Demo of Code </h2>




<h2> TO-DO </h2>

- [x] Implement Mask-RCNN model inference route using FastAPI and PyTorch.
- [x] Implement browser front end using ReactJS and Axios.
- [ ] Add object segmentor route and render inference on front end.
- [ ] Set up Dockerfiles for front end and back end.
